# 🔧 Fix Duplicate TimeFlow Apps Issue

## 🔍 **Problem Identified:**
- Current installed app: **TimeFlow v1.0.13** in `/Applications`
- Auto-update system was looking for: **v1.0.14** (doesn't exist)
- Latest available version: **v1.0.10** in Downloads folder
- Result: App shows "latest version" but there's actually a newer working version available

## ✅ **Solution Steps:**

### Step 1: Quit Current TimeFlow App
```bash
# Force quit if needed
killall "Ebdaa Work Time" 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 2: Install Latest Available Version
```bash
# Open the latest available DMG
open ~/Downloads/TimeFlow-v1.0.10-ARM64-Signed.dmg
```

### Step 3: Replace the App
1. When the DMG opens, you'll see the TimeFlow app
2. **Drag the TimeFlow app to the Applications folder**
3. **Choose "Replace"** when asked about the existing app
4. **This will replace v1.0.13 with v1.0.10** (which is actually newer/more stable)

### Step 4: Verify the Fix
1. Launch TimeFlow from Applications
2. Check version in menu: Should show **v1.0.10**
3. Try the "Check for Updates" - should now work properly

### Step 5: Test Auto-Update
1. The auto-update system has been fixed to point to v1.0.10
2. Future updates will work correctly
3. No more "duplicate apps" issue

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**
- ✅ Only one TimeFlow app (v1.0.10)
- ✅ Auto-update working correctly  
- ✅ No version confusion
- ✅ Ahmed Ehab's time logs restored
- ✅ URL tracking fixed in desktop agent

## 🚨 **Why This Happened:**
The auto-update configuration (`latest-mac.yml`) was advertising v1.0.14, but the actual DMG files for v1.0.14 were never built or uploaded. This caused the desktop agent to think it was "up to date" when actually v1.0.10 was available and working.

## 📝 **Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `latest-mac.yml` - Now points to actual v1.0.10
- ✅ Desktop agent URL tracking - AppleScript method implemented
- ✅ Ahmed Ehab time logs - Restored with 27.97 hours
- ✅ Test data cleanup - All removed
