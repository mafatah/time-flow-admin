-- Fix RLS policies for desktop app data collection
-- This migration allows the desktop app to save activity data without authentication issues

-- Temporarily disable RLS on all tables that the desktop app needs to write to
-- This allows the desktop app to function while we work on proper authentication

-- Disable RLS on app_logs table
ALTER TABLE public.app_logs DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Disable RLS on url_logs table  
ALTER TABLE public.url_logs DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Disable RLS on idle_logs table
ALTER TABLE public.idle_logs DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Disable RLS on time_logs table
ALTER TABLE public.time_logs DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Screenshots table is already handled in previous migration

-- Create simple policies that allow all operations for now
CREATE POLICY "Allow all app_logs operations" ON public.app_logs
FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all url_logs operations" ON public.url_logs  
FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all idle_logs operations" ON public.idle_logs
FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all time_logs operations" ON public.time_logs
FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- Also ensure screenshots table has the right policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on screenshots" ON public.screenshots;
CREATE POLICY "Allow all screenshots operations" ON public.screenshots
FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- Add comments explaining this is temporary
COMMENT ON POLICY "Allow all app_logs operations" ON public.app_logs IS 'Temporary policy to allow desktop app to function - should be refined with proper auth later';
COMMENT ON POLICY "Allow all url_logs operations" ON public.url_logs IS 'Temporary policy to allow desktop app to function - should be refined with proper auth later';
