## Overview
This document outlines the major new features implemented for the TimeFlow Admin application, focusing on enhanced employee management, financial tracking, and suspicious activity detection.

## 👥 2. Employee Settings Management

### Features
- **Per-employee screenshot frequency configuration**
- **Salary management (hourly vs monthly)**
- **Minimum hours requirements**
- **Overtime rate settings**
- **Custom monitoring intervals**

### Page: `/employee-settings`

### Key Functionality

- ✅ Set salary type (hourly/monthly)
- ✅ Define minimum monthly hours
- ✅ Set overtime rates
- ✅ Add notes for each employee
- ✅ Visual badges showing current settings
- ✅ Bulk editing capabilities

### Database Tables
```sql
employee_salary_settings:
- salary_type (hourly/monthly)
- hourly_rate, monthly_salary
- minimum_hours_monthly
- overtime_rate
- screenshot_frequency_seconds
- effective_from, notes
```

## 💰 3. Finance & Payroll System

### Features
- **Automated salary calculations**
- **Hours-based deductions**
- **Overtime pay calculations**
- **Monthly payroll reports**
- **Payment tracking**

### Page: `/finance`

### Key Functionality
- ✅ Calculate monthly payroll for all employees

- ✅ Apply deductions for unmet hour requirements
- ✅ Calculate overtime pay automatically
- ✅ Mark payments as paid/unpaid
- ✅ Edit payroll records with notes
- ✅ Export-ready payroll data

### Calculation Logic
```
For Hourly Employees:
- Regular Pay = min(hours_worked, minimum_hours) × hourly_rate
- Overtime Pay = max(0, hours_worked - minimum_hours) × overtime_rate

For Monthly Employees:
- Base Salary = monthly_salary
- If hours < minimum: Deduction = (minimum_hours - actual_hours) × (monthly_salary / minimum_hours)
- If hours > minimum: Overtime = (actual_hours - minimum_hours) × overtime_rate
```

### Database Tables
```sql
employee_payroll:
- total_hours_worked, regular_hours, overtime_hours
- base_salary, overtime_pay, deductions, final_salary
- is_paid, paid_at, notes
- month_year (unique per employee)
```
