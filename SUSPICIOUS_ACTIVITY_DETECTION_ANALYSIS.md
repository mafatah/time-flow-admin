## Risk Scoring System

### Risk Calculation
The system calculates risk scores based on:
- **Social Media Usage** (+2 points per visit)
- **Entertainment Sites** (+3 points per visit)
- **Gaming Activities** (+4 points per visit)
- **Shopping Sites** (+2 points per visit)
- **News Consumption** (+1 point per visit)
- **Idle Time** (hours × 2 points)
- **Suspicious App Usage** (+3 points per app)

### Risk Levels
- **🔴 Critical Risk (80-100%)** - Immediate attention required
- **🟠 High Risk (60-79%)** - Significant unproductive behavior
- **🟡 Medium Risk (40-59%)** - Moderate concerns
- **🟢 Low Risk (0-39%)** - Normal activity patterns

## Behavioral Flags

The system automatically flags employees for:
- **High social media usage** (>20 visits)
- **Excessive news consumption** (>15 visits)
- **High idle time** (>30% of work hours)
- **Entertainment apps during work** (>10 instances)
- **Suspicious content in screenshots** (>30% of captures)
- **Low activity level** (<50% productivity)
- **Unproductive website usage** (>25 visits)

## Real-Time Monitoring

### Detection Patterns
- **Activity Drop Detection** - Identifies sudden decreases in productivity
- **Long Session Monitoring** - Flags sessions >5 hours without breaks
- **Low Activity Alerts** - Detects <30% activity for 30+ minutes
- **Unusual Behavior Patterns** - AI-powered anomaly detection

### Notification System
- **Immediate Alerts** for critical risk behaviors
- **Email Notifications** for unusual activity
- **Dashboard Alerts** for administrators
- **Automated Reporting** with detailed analytics

## Configuration Options

### Customizable Settings
- **Risk Thresholds** (0%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%)
- **Date Range Analysis** (1-30 days)
- **Employee Filtering** (Individual or all employees)
- **Detection Sensitivity** (Configurable thresholds)

### Time Tracking
- **Idle Time Monitoring** with 1-second granularity
- **Screenshot Intervals** (configurable timing)
- **Activity Correlation** with screenshots and logs
- **Pattern Recognition** over time periods

## Answer to Your Question

**YES, the Suspicious Activity Detection system IS working** and will detect when you:

✅ **Visit Social Media Sites** (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.)
✅ **Browse Entertainment Content** (YouTube, Netflix, etc.)
✅ **Read News Websites** (CNN, BBC, etc.)
✅ **Shop Online** (Amazon, eBay, etc.)
✅ **Use Gaming Applications** (Steam, Discord, etc.)
✅ **Have High Idle Time** (periods of inactivity)
✅ **Show Suspicious Activity Patterns** (mouse jiggling, auto-clicking)

## Detection Accuracy

The system uses multiple detection methods:
- **URL Monitoring** - Tracks all website visits
- **Application Monitoring** - Monitors running applications
- **Screenshot Analysis** - Visual content recognition
- **Behavioral Analysis** - Pattern detection algorithms
- **Time Correlation** - Activity timeline analysis

## Recommendations

1. **Assume Full Monitoring** - The system tracks ALL web activity and applications
2. **Separate Personal/Work Browsing** - Use personal devices for non-work activities
3. **Take Legitimate Breaks** - System accounts for normal break patterns
4. **Be Aware of Risk Thresholds** - Even moderate usage can trigger alerts
5. **Understand Screenshot Monitoring** - All screen content is analyzed

## Conclusion

The Suspicious Activity Detection system is **fully operational** and uses sophisticated AI-powered analysis to identify unproductive employee behavior. It will detect social media usage, entertainment consumption, and other non-work activities with high accuracy through multiple monitoring channels including URL tracking, application monitoring, screenshot analysis, and behavioral pattern recognition.
