# Desktop Agent

This folder contains a lightweight Electron application that captures screenshots and tracks idle time in the background.

## Setup

From the `desktop-agent` directory install dependencies and start the agent:

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` to set your `user_id`, optional `project_id` and Supabase credentials before running the agent.
