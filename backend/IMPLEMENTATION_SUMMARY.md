- **Service role** for backend operations

### API Endpoints

#### Time Tracking
- `POST /api/time/start` - Start time tracking session
- `POST /api/time/stop` - Stop active session
- `GET /api/time-logs` - Retrieve time logs with filtering

#### Activity Logging
- `POST /api/apps` - Batch insert application logs
- `POST /api/urls` - Batch insert URL logs
- Automatic duration calculation and categorization

#### Screenshots
- `POST /api/screenshots/batch` - Upload up to 10 screenshots
- `GET /api/screenshots` - Retrieve screenshots with filtering
- `GET /api/screenshots/timeline` - Daily timeline view
- `GET /api/screenshots/activity-summary` - Activity analytics
- **Image processing** with blur and optimization

#### Analytics & Insights
- `GET /api/insights/unusual-activity` - Detect unusual patterns
- `GET /api/insights/productivity` - Productivity metrics
- `GET /api/insights/unusual-activity/history` - Historical data

#### Dashboard
- `GET /api/dashboard` - Aggregated dashboard data
- Real-time user activity status
- Weekly and daily statistics

#### Notifications
- `GET /api/notifications` - User notifications

### Background Workers (BullMQ)

#### Activity Analyzer (Every 5 minutes)
- Calculates `activity_percent` and `focus_percent`
- Analyzes app/URL logs in 4-minute windows
- Classifies activity as `core`, `non_core`, or `unproductive`

#### Unusual Detector (Every 10 minutes)
- **Low Activity**: <30% activity for 30+ minutes
- **Long Session**: >5 hours continuous work
- **Activity Drop**: >50 point drop over 2 hours

#### Notification Pusher (Every minute)
- Delivers pending notifications via Slack/email
- Updates delivery status tracking
- Retry logic for failed deliveries

### Image Processing
- **Sharp library** integration for high-performance processing
- **Blur functionality** for privacy protection
- **Image optimization** with quality control
- **Metadata extraction** for analytics
- **File size management** and compression

### Services Architecture

#### Common Services
