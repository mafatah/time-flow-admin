## 🆕 New Console Logging Features

### 1. **App Capture Database Confirmation**
When an app is detected and saved to database:
```
✅ [APP-CAPTURE] 🗄️ SAVED TO DATABASE: "Cursor" | Window: "terminal session" | Time: 6:35:27 PM
📊 [LAST APP DETECTED & SAVED]: App="Cursor" | Category="core" | User: user_id | TimeLog: time_log_id
```

### 2. **URL Capture Database Confirmation** 
When a URL is detected and saved to database:
```
✅ [URL-CAPTURE] 🗄️ SAVED TO DATABASE: "https://example.com" | Domain: "example.com" | Browser: "Chrome" | Time: 6:35:27 PM
📊 [LAST URL DETECTED & SAVED]: URL="https://example.com" | Title="Page Title" | User: user_id | TimeLog: time_log_id
```

### 3. **Periodic Database Status Reports**
Every 30 seconds, shows the last data actually saved to database:
```
📊 [DATABASE STATUS REPORT] ==========================================
📱 [LAST APP IN DATABASE]: "Cursor" | Window: "terminal session" | 45s ago
🌐 [LAST URL IN DATABASE]: "null" | Domain: "127.0.0.1" | Browser: "Safari" | 120s ago
