# TimeFlow Release Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Download page pointing to broken URLs**: Used `vv1.0.19` (double v) and incorrect naming
2. **Version mismatch**: Download page shows v1.0.19, but GitHub releases are at v1.0.16  
3. **Naming inconsistency**: "Ebdaa Work Time" vs "TimeFlow" vs "Ebdaa-Work-Time"
4. **Auto-updater misconfiguration**: YAML files don't match actual GitHub release assets
5. **Missing Windows/Linux builds**: Only Mac builds available for v1.0.19

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ 1. Fixed Download Page
- Updated URLs to point to working GitHub releases (v1.0.16)
- Fixed naming convention to match actual release assets
- Removed double "vv" prefix bug
- Used template literals for proper URL generation

### ✅ 2. Fixed Auto-Updater Configuration
- Updated `latest-mac.yml` to point to correct Mac release assets
- Updated `latest.yml` to include both Windows and Linux files
- Fixed version numbers to match actual releases
- Corrected file naming conventions

### ✅ 3. Created Deployment Scripts
- **`scripts/build-and-release-v1.0.19.sh`**: Comprehensive build script for all platforms
- **`scripts/upload-v1.0.19-release.sh`**: Upload script with proper GitHub release creation
- Both scripts handle code signing, notarization, and proper file naming

## Quick Fix (Immediate)

To fix the current download issues immediately:

```bash
# The download page now points to working v1.0.16 releases
# Auto-updater files now match GitHub assets
# Deploy the web app to apply these fixes
```

## Full v1.0.19 Deployment

To deploy the complete v1.0.19 release with all platforms:

### Prerequisites
1. Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh`
2. Authenticate: `gh auth login`
3. Ensure certificates are properly configured for code signing

### Step 1: Build All Platforms
```bash
# This will build Mac, Windows, and Linux versions
./scripts/build-and-release-v1.0.19.sh
```

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub (if not done automatically)
```bash
# This will create GitHub release and upload assets
./scripts/upload-v1.0.19-release.sh
```

### Step 3: Deploy Web App
```bash
# Deploy the updated web application
npm run build
# Deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
```

## Security Features

- **Code Signing**: All Mac builds are signed with your Developer Certificate
- **Notarization**: Mac builds are notarized with Apple (Team ID: 6GW49LK9V9)
- **Hash Verification**: All files include SHA512 hashes for integrity verification
- **Secure Updates**: Auto-updater verifies signatures before applying updates

## Testing

1. **Download Page**: Visit your download page to verify all links work
2. **Auto-Updates**: Test that existing apps can update to the new version
3. **Installation**: Test installation on each platform
4. **Code Signing**: Verify no security warnings on macOS

## Current Status

- ✅ Download page fixed (pointing to working v1.0.16 releases)
- ✅ Auto-updater configuration fixed
- ✅ Build scripts created for v1.0.19 deployment
- ⏳ v1.0.19 release needs to be built and uploaded
- ⏳ Web app needs to be deployed

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Deploy the web app with the current fixes
2. **Short-term**: Run the build script to create v1.0.19 releases
3. **Long-term**: Set up automated CI/CD for future releases
