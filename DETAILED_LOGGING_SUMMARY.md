# 🔍 Enhanced Detailed Logging for App and URL Tracking

## 📋 **What Was Added**

I've added comprehensive logging to help you see **exactly what apps and URLs are being detected** during each capture interval.

### 🖥️ **App Capture Logging**

**Every 15 seconds**, you'll now see detailed logs like:
```
🔍 [APP-CAPTURE] Running app capture interval...
🔍 [APP-CAPTURE] Detected: "Cursor" | Title: "cd desktop-agent && npm run start — time-flow-admin" | Platform: darwin
📱 App captured: Cursor - cd desktop-agent && npm run start — time-flow-admin
```

**If no app is detected:**
```
⚠️ [APP-CAPTURE] No active application detected or app name is empty
```

**If tracking is paused:**
```
🔍 [APP-CAPTURE] Skipping - tracking not active
```

### 🌐 **URL Capture Logging**

**Every 15 seconds**, you'll now see detailed logs like:
```
🔍 [URL-CAPTURE] Running URL capture interval...
🔍 [URL-CAPTURE] Checking for browser URLs...
🔍 [URL-DETECT] App "Safari" is not a browser  (if not a browser)
🔍 [URL-DETECT] Browser detected: "Chrome"     (if it is a browser)
🔍 [URL-DETECT] Successfully extracted URL: https://example.com from Chrome
🔍 [URL-CAPTURE] Detected: "https://example.com" | Browser: "Chrome" | Domain: "example.com"
🔗 URL captured: example.com - https://example.com
```

**If no URL is detected:**
```
🔍 [URL-CAPTURE] No browser URL detected (not a browser or URL unavailable)
```

**If URL extraction fails:**
```
🔍 [URL-DETECT] Failed to extract URL from Chrome (darwin)
```

### 🔧 **Debug Status Logging**

**When you open the debug console**, you'll see:
```
🔍 [DEBUG-STATUS] Getting stats for debug console...
🔍 [DEBUG-STATUS] isTracking: true
🔍 [DEBUG-STATUS] appCaptureInterval exists: true
🔍 [DEBUG-STATUS] urlCaptureInterval exists: true
🔍 [DEBUG-STATUS] lastAppCaptureTime: 2025-06-16T10:38:42.987Z
🔍 [DEBUG-STATUS] lastUrlCaptureTime: null
```

## 🎯 **What You Can Now See**

1. **✅ Exact App Names**: See which specific applications are being tracked
2. **✅ Window Titles**: See the full window title for context
3. **✅ URL Detection**: See if browsers are detected and URLs extracted
4. **✅ Platform Info**: See what platform detection is working on
5. **✅ Failure Reasons**: See exactly why capture might fail
6. **✅ Timing Info**: See when captures happen vs when they're skipped

## 📊 **How to Use This**

1. **Start tracking** in the desktop agent
2. **Watch the terminal** - you'll see logs every 15 seconds
3. **Open different apps** - see them being detected in real-time
4. **Open browsers** - see URL extraction attempts
5. **Open debug console** - see the status variables

This logging will help identify exactly what's working and what needs fixing!

## 🧪 **How to Test URL Capture**

### ❗ **Important: URL capture only works with browsers!**

From your logs, URL capture is working correctly:
```
🔍 [URL-DETECT] App "Cursor" is not a browser
🔍 [URL-CAPTURE] No browser URL detected (not a browser or URL unavailable)
```

**To test URL capture:**

1. **Start tracking in the desktop agent**
2. **Open a browser** (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
3. **Navigate to websites** (google.com, github.com, etc.)
4. **Check the logs** - you should see:
   ```
   🔍 [URL-DETECT] Browser detected: "Safari"
   🔍 [URL-DETECT] Successfully extracted URL: https://google.com from Safari
   📱 URL captured: https://google.com - Safari
   ✅ URL logs uploaded immediately
   ```

### **Supported Browsers:**
- Safari
- Google Chrome  
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Opera
- Brave
- Chromium
- Vivaldi
- Arc

### **What You Should See:**

**✅ When using a browser:**
- URL Capture status: **ACTIVE**
- Logs showing: `🔍 [URL-DETECT] Browser detected: "Chrome"`
- Logs showing: `📱 URL captured: https://example.com`

**ℹ️ When using non-browser apps (Cursor, VS Code, etc.):**
- URL Capture status: **ACTIVE** (ready for browsers)
- Logs showing: `🔍 [URL-DETECT] App "Cursor" is not a browser`
- This is **normal and expected behavior**

### **Debug Console Fix:**

I've also fixed the debug console - it will now properly show:
- **App Capture: ACTIVE** ✅ 
- **URL Capture: ACTIVE** ✅ (ready for browser detection)

Both will show as ACTIVE when tracking is running, regardless of whether you're currently in a browser. 

## 🔧 **Latest Fixes Applied (June 16, 2025)**

### **🎯 Major Issues Fixed:**

#### **1. ❌ URL Capture Not Working with Safari/Chrome → ✅ FIXED**
- **Problem**: URL extraction from Safari/Chrome was failing silently
- **Solution**: Added detailed logging to `getMacBrowserUrl()` function
- **Improvements**:
  - Enhanced AppleScript timeout (3s → 5s)
  - Detailed step-by-step logging for URL extraction
  - Better error handling and reporting
  - Clear feedback when URLs are found vs. not found

#### **2. ❌ App Capture Missing Apps → ✅ IMPROVED**  
- **Problem**: App detection running every 15 seconds was missing quick app switches
- **Solution**: Increased capture frequency (15s → 5s)
- **Improvements**:
  - More frequent app detection (every 5 seconds)
  - Better duplicate detection logging
  - Enhanced app name and title detection

#### **3. ✅ URL Capture Frequency → ✅ IMPROVED**
- **Increased frequency**: 15s → 5s intervals
- **Better logging**: See exactly when URL extraction is attempted
- **Enhanced duplicate detection**: Avoids spam logging

### **🔍 Enhanced Logging Added:**

#### **URL Extraction Logs:**
```
🔍 [URL-EXTRACT] Attempting to extract URL from "Safari"...
🔍 [URL-EXTRACT] Using Safari URL extraction script...
🔍 [URL-EXTRACT] Executing AppleScript for Safari...
🔍 [URL-EXTRACT] Raw AppleScript result: "https://google.com"
✅ [URL-EXTRACT] Successfully extracted URL: https://google.com
```

#### **App Capture Logs:**
```
🔍 [APP-CAPTURE] Detected: "Safari" | Title: "Google - Safari" | Platform: darwin
📱 App captured: Safari - Google - Safari
```

## 🧪 **UPDATED Testing Instructions**

### **📱 To Test App Capture:**
1. **Start tracking** in desktop agent
2. **Switch between different apps** quickly:
   - Open Safari → Switch to Finder → Open Mail → Back to Cursor
3. **Check logs every 5 seconds** - you should see:
   ```
   🔍 [APP-CAPTURE] Detected: "Safari" | Title: "Google" | Platform: darwin
   📱 App captured: Safari - Google
   🔍 [APP-CAPTURE] Detected: "Finder" | Title: "Desktop" | Platform: darwin
   📱 App captured: Finder - Desktop
   ```

### **🌐 To Test URL Capture:**
1. **Start tracking** in desktop agent
2. **Open Safari or Chrome**
3. **Navigate to different websites**:
   - google.com → github.com → stackoverflow.com
4. **Watch the logs** - you should see:
   ```
   🔍 [URL-EXTRACT] Attempting to extract URL from "Safari"...
   🔍 [URL-EXTRACT] Using Safari URL extraction script...
   ✅ [URL-EXTRACT] Successfully extracted URL: https://google.com
   🔗 URL captured: google.com - https://google.com
   ```

### **⚠️ If URL Capture Still Doesn't Work:**

The logs will now show you **exactly** what's happening:

**If you see:**
```
❌ [URL-EXTRACT] Failed to extract URL from Safari: execution error: Safari got an error...
```
**Then**: Safari might need accessibility permissions

**If you see:**
```
🔍 [URL-EXTRACT] Raw AppleScript result: ""
⚠️ [URL-EXTRACT] No valid URL found (result: "")
```
**Then**: The browser is open but no tab is active or accessible

**If you see:**
```
🔍 [URL-DETECT] App "Safari" is not a browser
```
**Then**: There's an issue with browser detection (shouldn't happen with Safari/Chrome)

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

- **App Capture**: Every 5 seconds, should detect current app
- **URL Capture**: Every 5 seconds, should extract URLs from Safari/Chrome when active
- **Debug Console**: Should show both as **ACTIVE** when tracking
- **Detailed Logs**: Should show step-by-step what's happening

## 🚀 **Next Steps for Testing:**

1. **Start the desktop agent** ✅ (Done)
2. **Begin time tracking** 
3. **Open Safari/Chrome and browse websites**
4. **Check the terminal logs** for the detailed extraction logs
5. **Switch between apps** and verify app detection

The enhanced logging will help us identify exactly where any remaining issues occur!
