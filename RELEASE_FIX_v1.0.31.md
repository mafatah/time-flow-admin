```

## 🚀 **Immediate Action Required**

1. **Set GitHub Token**: Export your GitHub personal access token
2. **Create Release**: Run the gh release create command above
3. **Verify Links**: Check that download links work:
   - https://github.com/mafatah/time-flow-admin/releases/download/v1.0.31/TimeFlow-v1.0.31-Setup.exe

## 📱 **Download Links That Need Fixing**
These URLs are currently broken and need the GitHub release:
- Windows: `https://github.com/mafatah/time-flow-admin/releases/download/v1.0.31/TimeFlow-v1.0.31-Setup.exe`
- macOS ARM64: `https://github.com/mafatah/time-flow-admin/releases/download/v1.0.31/TimeFlow-v1.0.31-ARM64.dmg`
- macOS Intel: `https://github.com/mafatah/time-flow-admin/releases/download/v1.0.31/TimeFlow-v1.0.31-Intel.dmg`

## 🔄 **Next Steps After Release**

1. **Update macOS builds**: The DMG files are currently placeholders and need proper builds
2. **Test auto-updater**: Verify the auto-update system works with the new release
3. **Monitor downloads**: Check download analytics to ensure users can access the files

## 🛠️ **Long-term Solution**

To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always run the complete automated release pipeline
2. Verify all files are properly built before updating version numbers
3. Test download links immediately after release creation
